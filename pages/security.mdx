# Security & Privacy

This page summarises Aescia’s security posture for clinical evaluation contexts. Formal validation is expected to occur through standard public-sector procurement and security review processes.


## Data residency
Aescia is intended to support **Australian data residency** for Australian public hospital evaluations.

## Encryption
- Encryption in transit (e.g., Transport Layer Security)
- Encryption at rest

## Access controls and auditability
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging of access and key actions
- Principle of least privilege for administrative access

## Subprocessors
Aescia may use subprocessors to deliver functionality (e.g., messaging). Subprocessors and their roles should be disclosed and contractually controlled for any evaluation.

## Incident response
Aescia maintains an incident response approach, including containment, investigation, notification, and remediation processes consistent with contractual and regulatory expectations.

## Retention and deletion
Evaluation data retention periods and deletion processes should be defined per site requirements and contract terms.

## Evaluation security documentation
For a paid evaluation, we expect to provide (at minimum):
- security overview and architecture summary
- subprocessor list and data flow description
- access control model and audit logging approach
- incident response summary and notification timeframes
