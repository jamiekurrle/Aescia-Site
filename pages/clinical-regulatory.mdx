# Clinical & Regulatory

This page summarises Aescia’s intended use and regulatory posture for evaluation contexts.

## Intended use
Aescia supports post-discharge monitoring and escalation workflows by collecting structured patient-reported information and presenting it for clinical review.

## Not intended for
Aescia is not intended to:
- provide autonomous diagnosis
- provide autonomous treatment decisions
- replace clinical judgement
- be used as the sole basis for escalation or non-escalation decisions
- be used for emergency triage

## Clinician-in-the-loop model
Aescia outputs are reviewed by clinicians or delegated clinical staff according to local governance. The hospital retains responsibility for clinical decisions and escalation actions.

## Software as a Medical Device positioning
Aescia is positioned as **Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)** for regulatory purposes. Evaluation use is limited to approved clinical evaluation contexts and does not imply regulatory clearance for routine clinical deployment.

## Evaluation-only status
Any evaluation is subject to:
- local governance approvals
- privacy and security review
- ethics approval where applicable
- a defined evaluation protocol and scope limitations
