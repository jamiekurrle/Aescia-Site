## What to include in an evaluation enquiry
- Health service and unit
- Target cohort and approximate discharge volumes
- Whether the engagement is research (HREC) or operational evaluation
- Preferred timeframe and any hard constraints (privacy, hosting, integration)

If you are an Australian public hospital, include the relevant digital health, privacy, and clinical governance contacts so we can coordinate approvals.
