# Evidence & Evaluations

This page summarises the current evidence status for Aescia. Independent, peer-reviewed outcome data is not yet available.

## Current evaluations

Aescia is undergoing early clinical evaluation in Australian public hospital settings, with an initial focus on post-discharge monitoring and escalation workflows following cardiothoracic surgery.

These evaluations are being conducted under defined governance and ethics frameworks and are not routine clinical deployments.

## Trial registration and public records

Formal evaluations of Aescia may be registered with recognised clinical trial registries.

- **Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR):**  
  ACTRN12625001425482p — *Artificial Intelligence Enhanced After-Discharge Care After Cardiothoracic Surgery*  
  Public record: https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12625001425482p

The registry entry reflects the current ethics submission status. Registration does not imply completed recruitment, published outcomes, or regulatory clearance.

## Ethics status

Clinical evaluations may require review by a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). Where initial submissions receive feedback, protocol refinement and resubmission may be required prior to commencement.

Evaluation activities do not proceed without appropriate approvals.

## Publications

As of today, there are **no peer-reviewed outcome publications** relating to Aescia.

Where permitted by ethics and governance arrangements, evaluation findings — including neutral or negative results — may be published in the future.

## Evaluation principles

For any site-specific evaluation, Aescia recommends pre-defining:

- primary and secondary endpoints (e.g. escalation events, readmissions, workflow impact)
- safety monitoring (missed deterioration, response times)
- operational metrics (adoption, clinician time burden)
- qualitative feedback from clinicians and patients

These parameters are agreed with the participating health service prior to commencement.

## Transparency

Aescia does not present early evaluations as evidence of clinical effectiveness beyond their defined scope. Evaluation results are intended to inform future research, governance decisions, and regulatory pathways rather than substitute for formal evidence generation.
