# Evidence & Evaluations

This page summarises Aescia’s current evidence status. At present, no peer-reviewed outcome publications are available.

## Current evaluations
Aescia is pursuing clinical evaluation in Australian public hospital settings, including cardiothoracic surgery workflows.

## Trial registration and public references
Where applicable, evaluations may be referenced via:
- a public clinical trial registry listing (e.g., ANZCTR)
- an institutional innovation or collaboration listing

Links will be published here once they are publicly available.

## Ethics status
Evaluations may require Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) submission and approval. Where an initial submission receives feedback, resubmission may be required.

## Publications
As of today, there may be no peer-reviewed outcome publications available.

## Evaluation principles
For any site evaluation, we recommend pre-defining:
- endpoints (e.g., readmission, escalation events, length of stay proxies where appropriate)
- safety monitoring (missed deterioration, response times)
- workflow metrics (adoption, time burden)
- qualitative feedback (staff and patient experience)
