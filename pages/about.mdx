# About Aescia

Aescia is an Australian digital health company focused on supporting post-discharge monitoring and escalation workflows through clinician-in-the-loop software.

The company’s initial focus is on high-risk surgical and medical cohorts where deterioration often occurs after discharge and where timely clinical review can improve outcomes and resource use.

## Who we are

Aescia operates as an Australian proprietary company and engages with public hospitals under defined clinical evaluation and governance frameworks.

The company is led by clinicians and technologists with experience in acute care environments. Clinical decisions remain the responsibility of the treating health service at all times.

## What we do

Aescia provides software intended to:
- collect structured patient-reported information following discharge
- surface relevant signals to clinical teams
- support existing escalation and follow-up workflows

The platform is designed to complement, not replace, established models of care such as hospital-in-the-home, outpatient follow-up, and nurse-led monitoring.

## How we work with public hospitals

Aescia engages with public health services through:
- time-limited, scoped clinical evaluations
- site-specific governance and privacy approvals
- ethics review where required
- predefined evaluation endpoints and reporting

Aescia does not promote routine clinical deployment without appropriate approvals and does not seek to bypass established hospital governance processes.

## Clinical responsibility

Aescia is designed as a **clinician-in-the-loop** system.

The software does not provide autonomous diagnosis, treatment decisions, or emergency triage. All outputs are advisory and reviewed by clinicians or delegated clinical staff in accordance with local policies.

## Regulatory posture

Aescia is positioned as **Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)** for regulatory purposes.

Use of the platform is limited to approved evaluation contexts pending completion of evidence generation and regulatory pathways. Evaluation use does not imply regulatory clearance for routine clinical deployment.

## Governance and transparency

Aescia maintains documented approaches to:
- clinical governance and risk management
- data security and privacy
- evaluation reporting and transparency
