# Governance

This page summarises Aescia’s governance approach for clinical evaluation engagements.

## Legal entity
Aescia Pty Ltd (Australia). ABN and GST registration available on public registries.

## Accountability and clinical responsibility
Aescia is designed as a **clinician-in-the-loop** workflow support tool. Clinical decisions remain the responsibility of the treating clinical team at all times.

## Clinical governance approach
For evaluation deployments, Aescia operates under:
- site-specific governance approval processes (e.g., digital health, clinical governance, and privacy review)
- a documented risk assessment for the evaluation scope
- role clarity for escalation pathways (who monitors, who responds, timeframes)

## Ethics and evaluation posture
Aescia is used under clinical evaluation or research frameworks only, subject to appropriate approvals. The platform is not marketed for routine clinical deployment without governance approval.

## Reporting and transparency
Evaluation reporting should be agreed in advance (endpoints, adverse events, usage metrics, and qualitative feedback). Where permitted, neutral or negative findings may be reported.
