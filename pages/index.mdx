# Post-discharge monitoring that scales

Aescia supports structured patient follow-up after discharge, helping clinical teams detect deterioration earlier and standardise escalation pathways.

## What Aescia does

- **Daily check-ins** aligned to a patient’s discharge context and recovery pathway
- **Escalation workflows** when symptoms cross predefined thresholds
- **Clinician-facing triage views** to support prioritisation and follow-up
- **Audit-friendly reporting** to support governance, safety, and evaluation

## Where it fits

Aescia is designed to support follow-up and recovery monitoring across a range of care settings, including:

- **Hospital services** with high follow-up burden (for example cardiothoracic surgery and other high-risk cohorts)
- **Private hospitals** seeking scalable discharge support and reduced avoidable re-presentations
- **Clinics and day procedures** that want a consistent recovery experience and earlier identification of complications

## How it’s different

Aescia focuses on practical, lightweight workflows that can integrate with real-world clinical operations:

- **Low-friction patient experience** designed for high completion rates
- **Configurable pathways** that can be tailored to service needs
- **Conservative escalation logic** with clinician oversight (early-stage evaluation focus)

## Evidence, privacy, and governance

Aescia is being developed with a conservative approach to safety, privacy, and clinical evaluation.
